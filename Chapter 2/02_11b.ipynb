Initially set for a March rollout with the iOS 26.4 beta, the functional changes may now be deferred to future updates, possibly in May or September with iOS 27. Despite the potential delay, analysts believe Apple's long-term AI strategy, including a rumored AI chatbot for Siri, still holds significant value for investors, especially as the company reported a strong Q1 2026 driven by iPhone sales.\",\n",
